            Hi, Iâ€™m Santhosh Kumar â€” a passionate Frontend Developer with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and an MBA in Systems & Finance.
            I specialize in building responsive, dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.
            With experience designing clean user interfaces, reusable components, and scalable architecture,
            I love turning ideas into maintainable, modern websites.

            I previously worked as a Virtual Relationship Manager at HDFC Bank and have always been interested in technology â€” which inspired me to learn web development and create modern user interfaces.
